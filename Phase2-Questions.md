2. Please list all the questions you would ask other team members (PO and engineers) before starting this project.

   - What are the key features and benefits of Izari that we should highlight on the landing page?
   - How does Izari facilitate the connection to Filecoin, and what are some common use cases for this functionality?
   - Are there any design or branding guidelines that we need to follow when developing the landing page for Izari?
   - What is the target audience for Izari, and what are their pain points and needs?
   - What are the requirements for testing and quality assurance, and how can we ensure that the landing page meets these standards?
   - How can we ensure that the landing page is accessible and user-friendly, especially for those who may be less familiar with web3 and Izari?
   - Are there any third-party integrations or plugins that we should consider when developing the landing page, such as analytics tools or social media sharing buttons?
   - How can we measure the success of the landing page in promoting Izari, and what metrics should we track?
   - What are the specific requirements for the tech stack used to develop the landing page, and are there any particular libraries or frameworks that we should be using?
